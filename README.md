# webgl demos in a single file, the way god intended

^.^

This probably isn't useful to you unless you already hack on graphics programming enough to know the APIs by sight and just need to see the calls flat, without abstraction, so that you can quickly prototype something, and then see the best abstractions afterwards.

The exception here, for me, is matrix math, a blob of functions for which I simply paste into the top of each script. I've internalized a lot of CG relevant matrix math to the point where I can recite it from memory where necessary, but I'm not hacking on the primitives of matrix math so much as I'm trying to find really efficient ways to render :sparkles: quirky things :sparkles:. So each file just has a blob of matrix functions at the top.
